        RSS-To-Email is a free and <a href="https://github.com/portable-cto/rss-to-email" target="_blank">open
        source</a> tool created by <a href="https://www.portablecto.com/" target="_blank">Portable CTO</a> to make
        email newsletter generation easier.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        The project started out as a way to scratch our own itch as we send out a weekly email newsletter for <a
        href="https://mailchi.mp/a183cf10b418/startups">startups and side project owners</a> that consists mainly of
        content we curate from around the web. We could get the curated content into an RSS feed, but turning that
        into a simple, beautiful, HTML-friendly email wasn't quite so easy. While other tools exist, none was open
        source, so we decided to release RSS-To-Email as a freemium tool.
